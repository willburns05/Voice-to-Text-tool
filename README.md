# 🎙️ Voice-Paste — speak, release, and paste 🪄

Python utility for **macOS** that lets you hold **⌥ ⌘ V**, talk (≤ 30 s), and have the transcript pasted wherever your text cursor is.  
Powered by OpenAI’s **`gpt-4o-transcribe`** speech-to-text model.

> **Why?** It’s much faster than typing quick notes, chat replies, TODOs, or email paragraphs.

## ✨ Features

* Global hot-key **⌥ ⌘ V** → record → auto-paste  
* Uses state-of-the-art OpenAI Audio API (`gpt-4o-transcribe`; fallback toggle for `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` in code)  
* Multilingual, noise-robust, punctuation aware  
* Audio kept only in `~/Library/Caches/voice-paste/` and deleted after transcription  
* Console log with timestamps for debugging  
* Fails gracefully on network/API errors (daemon keeps running)
